        <p>The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, widely known as Vietnam, is not a strange name to the whole world.
            Although this country is ravaged by a series of wars which cause serious damages, Vietnam in the eyes
            of the world is nice and peaceful. Vietnam is located in the eastern Indochina Peninsula in Southeast
            Asia, with Hanoi as its capital. With an area of 331,690 sq. kilometers, to the north of Vietnam is
            China, to the west is Laos and Cambodia, to the east is Gulf of Tonkin and East Sea, and to the south
            is Thailand Gulf. The land is a center of trading, cultural interaction, and even conflicts for centuries.
            It proves that Vietnam has an advantageous position in the region with long coastline and numerous
            attractions.</p>
